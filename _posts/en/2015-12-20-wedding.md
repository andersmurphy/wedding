# Bus From Krakow to Opatow

The bus to Opatow leaves at 9:30am (on the dot) on Saturday morning (the day of the wedding). It departs from [Kurniki Street Krakow]. It will arrive at the [Panorama Hotel] (where you will be staying) at around 12:30pm (so make sure you have breakfast before leaving). There will be a bus taking people to the church at around 3:30pm, giving you a couple of hours to get ready.

Justyna (one of our friends) will be the point of contact for the bus, her number is +48791006744, so if you need any help finding the bus just give her a call.

A Note for the ladies: the hotel rooms don't have hairdryers, so ideally bring your own, if not they have a limited number of them at reception.
