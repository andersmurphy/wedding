We would love to celebrate our special day with you!

So please save the date and let us know as soon as you can whether you'll be able to make it.

# The Wedding
This will be a proper Polish wedding so if you are not used to drinking large amounts, it would be best to start practicing now.

There will be a coach that will pick you up from Krakow on Saturday morning and take everyone to their rooms giving enough time to get ready before the wedding starts. The venue is [Restauracja Zmigrod] in [Opatow], Poland.

The ceremony will start at the collegiate of St Marcin at 4pm, followed by the main reception in Zmigrod restaurant. The fun will continue till 5 in the morning!

The second day of the wedding will involve more food and more vodka (more details to follow).

Hotel rooms for guests will be provided for both the night of the wedding and the night of the second day.

# What To Expect
