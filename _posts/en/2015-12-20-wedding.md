We would love to celebrate our special day with you!

So please save the date and let us know as soon as you can whether you'll be able to make it.

#The Day
This will be a proper Polish wedding so if you are not used to drinking large amounts, it would be best to start practicing now.

There will be a coach that will pick you up from Krakow on Saturday morning and take everyone to their rooms giving enough time to get ready before the wedding starts. The venue is [Restauracja Zmigrod] in [Opatow], Poland.

The ceremony will start at the collegiate of St Marcin at 4pm, followed by the main reception in Zmigrod restaurant at 5pm. The fun will continue till 5 in the morning! Hotel rooms for guests will be provided for the night of the wedding.


#Plan Your Holiday
There are multiple options of direct flights from Edinburgh, Glasgow or London:

###Edinburgh to Krakow:
[Ryanair] - Thursday evening, flight back: Tuesday evening.
[Easyjet] - Wednesday or Friday morning, flight back: Monday or Wednesday.

###London to Krakow:
[British Airways] from Heathrow.
[Ryanair] from Stansted.
[Easyjet] from Gatwick.

And many more flights with stopovers.

It's worth checking [Skyscanner] or [Kayak] to best plan your journey if you're coming from other parts of the world; try picking Krakow as your destination airport.

[Krakow] is the most beautiful city in Poland, so it is worth spending a few days there before or after the wedding, depending on your flight.

Accommodation in Krakow starts from as little as £12 per person per night.

It's also worth checking [Airbnb] for a nice apartment.

We are happy to help with choosing your accommodation or any other questions you might have.
